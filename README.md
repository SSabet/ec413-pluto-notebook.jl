# Notebooks for Advanced Macroeconomics
This is a set of interactive [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks on topics discussed in beginning graduate level macroeconomics. It's built around the syllabus of the course Macroeconomics (EC413) taught at the LSE by [Matthias Doepke](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/mdo738/) and [Silvana Tenreyro](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/tenreyro/)(2023-2024). But it also includes some more advanced discussions, or related stuff I find interesting. 

The main aim is to make the transition from undergraduate to graduate Macroeconomics smoother, and to employ the fantastic [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and [PlutoUI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoUI.jl) tools to make the models more intuitive.

Below you can find the links to each notebook, dockerised on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
